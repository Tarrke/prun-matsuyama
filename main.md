### Shipping

As a result of frequent travels to Community Exchange stations, MTS offer their customer shipping services. At the moment the only CX Station deserved regularly is the MOR Station.

All shipping fees should be versed in NCC. Basic shipping fee will be 5 NCC per m3 or kg, whichever is the higher in your shipment.

We try to make our best efforts to satisfy everyone, be it in term of speed or in scheduling. If your order is very important and urgent please ask our CEO for a private meeting and a private shipment. More shipping fees may apply.

All times are in CEST. Please refer to [this website](https://time.is/en/CEST) to convert it to your timezone if required.
